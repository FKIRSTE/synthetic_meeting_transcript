Quantum Computing,"

A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster[a] than any modern ""classical"" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.

The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or ""quantum bit""), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.

Quantum computers are not yet practical for real work. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).

In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems unsolvable by a classical computer in any reasonable amount of time. This concept of extra ability has been called ""quantum supremacy"". While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited.

For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[1] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain the wave–particle duality observed at atomic scales,[2] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[3] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[4] and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[5]

As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[6]
When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[7] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[8][9][10]
In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.[11][12]

Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch's algorithm in 1985,[13] the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm in 1993,[14] and Simon's algorithm in 1994.[15]
These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[16]

Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie–Hellman encryption protocols,[17] which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover's algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.[18][19] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[20] validating Feynman's 1982 conjecture.[21]

Over the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[22]
In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[23][24] and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[22]

In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer.[25][26][27] However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.[28][29]

In December 2023, physicists, for the first time, reported the entanglement of individual molecules, which may have significant applications in quantum computing.[30]

Computer engineers typically describe a modern computer's operation in terms of classical electrodynamics.
Within these ""classical"" computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators) may rely on quantum behavior, but these components are not isolated from their environment, so any quantum information quickly decoheres.
While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm, quantum mechanical notions like superposition and interference are largely irrelevant for program analysis.

Quantum programs, in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems. Physicists describe these systems mathematically using linear algebra. Complex numbers model probability amplitudes, vectors model quantum states, and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.

As physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,[31]

A classical computer is a quantum computer ... so we shouldn't be asking about ""where do quantum speedups come from?"" We should say, ""well, all computers are quantum. ... Where do classical slowdowns come from?""
Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. The same term qubit is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states often written 




|

0
⟩


{\displaystyle |0\rangle }

 and 




|

1
⟩


{\displaystyle |1\rangle }

 serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states 




|

0
⟩


{\displaystyle |0\rangle }

 and 




|

1
⟩


{\displaystyle |1\rangle }

 belong to a vector space, meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state. Such a combination is known as a superposition of 




|

0
⟩


{\displaystyle |0\rangle }

 and 




|

1
⟩


{\displaystyle |1\rangle }

.[32][33]

A two-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use Dirac notation for quantum mechanical linear algebra, writing

{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }

 'ket psi' for a vector labeled 



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }

 are the standard basis states,[b] and 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 and 



β


{\displaystyle \beta }

 are the probability amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers.[33] If either 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 or 



β


{\displaystyle \beta }

 is zero, the qubit is effectively a classical bit; when both are nonzero, the qubit is in superposition. Such a quantum state vector acts similarly to a (classical) probability vector, with one key difference: unlike probabilities, probability amplitudes are not necessarily positive numbers.[35] Negative amplitudes allow for destructive wave interference.

When a qubit is measured in the standard basis, the result is a classical bit. The Born rule describes the norm-squared correspondence between amplitudes and probabilities—when measuring a qubit

Each additional qubit doubles the dimension of the state space.[34]
As an example, the vector ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|01⟩ represents a two-qubit state, a tensor product of the qubit |0⟩ with the qubit ⁠1/√2⁠|0⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|1⟩.
This vector inhabits a four-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩.
The Bell state ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|11⟩ is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubits—the two qubits are entangled because their probability amplitudes are correlated.
In general, the vector space for an n-qubit system is 2n-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2100 classical values.

The state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying quantum logic gates, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with classical logic gates. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a matrix




X
:=


(



0


1




1


0



)


.


{\displaystyle X:={\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}}.}


Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with matrix multiplication. Thus

The mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are

The controlled NOT (CNOT) gate can then be represented using the following matrix:

In summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

Quantum parallelism is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously. This can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated. The resulting state encodes the function's output values for all input values in the superposition, allowing for the computation of multiple outputs simultaneously. This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms. However, ""parallelism"" in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value. To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient.[36][37]

There are a number of models of computation for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed.

A quantum gate array decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit quantum gates. A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

 qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a universal gate set, since a computer that can run such circuits is a universal quantum computer. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Implementation of Boolean functions using the few-qubit quantum gates is presented here.[38]

A measurement-based quantum computer decomposes computation into a sequence of Bell state measurements and single-qubit quantum gates applied to a highly entangled initial state (a cluster state), using a technique called quantum gate teleportation.

An adiabatic quantum computer, based on quantum annealing, decomposes computation into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution.[39]

Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated as ‘n.quantum computing’) is an unconventional computing type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both, traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the “minimum”. Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation.

A topological quantum computer decomposes computation into the braiding of anyons in a 2D lattice.[40]

A quantum Turing machine is the quantum analog of a Turing machine.[6] All of these models of computation—quantum circuits,[41] one-way quantum computation,[42] adiabatic quantum computation,[43] and topological quantum computation[44]—have been shown to be equivalent to the quantum Turing machine; given a perfect implementation of one such quantum computer, it can simulate all the others with no more than polynomial overhead. This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical.

The threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can mitigate errors,[45] yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains ""a rather distant dream"".[46] According to some researchers, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their reliability.[46]
Scientists at Harvard University successfully created ""quantum circuits"" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may potentially remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers.[47][48] The Harvard research team was supported by MIT, QuEra Computing, Caltech, and Princeton University and funded by DARPA's Optimization with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices (ONISQ) program.[49][50]

Quantum computing has significant potential applications in the fields of cryptography and cybersecurity. Quantum cryptography, which relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, offers the possibility of secure communication channels that are resistant to eavesdropping. Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, such as BB84, enable the secure exchange of cryptographic keys between parties, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of communication. Moreover, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can produce high-quality random numbers, which are essential for secure encryption.

However, quantum computing also poses challenges to traditional cryptographic systems. Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, could potentially break widely used public-key cryptography schemes like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Post-quantum cryptography, which involves the development of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, is an active area of research aimed at addressing this concern.

Ongoing research in quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography is crucial for ensuring the security of communication and data in the face of evolving quantum computing capabilities. Advances in these fields, such as the development of new QKD protocols, the improvement of QRNGs, and the standardization of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, will play a key role in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of information in the quantum era.[51]

Quantum cryptography enables new ways to transmit data securely; for example, quantum key distribution uses entangled quantum states to establish secure cryptographic keys.[52] When a sender and receiver exchange quantum states, they can guarantee that an adversary does not intercept the message, as any unauthorized eavesdropper would disturb the delicate quantum system and introduce a detectable change.[53] With appropriate cryptographic protocols, the sender and receiver can thus establish shared private information resistant to eavesdropping.[11][54]

Modern fiber-optic cables can transmit quantum information over relatively short distances. Ongoing experimental research aims to develop more reliable hardware (such as quantum repeaters), hoping to scale this technology to long-distance quantum networks with end-to-end entanglement. Theoretically, this could enable novel technological applications, such as distributed quantum computing and enhanced quantum sensing.[55][56]

Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.[57]

Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, solving Pell's equation, and more generally solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups.[57] These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely.[58] Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.

Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are BQP-complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that no quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.[59]

Some quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms.[57] Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems.[19]

Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, quantum simulation may be an important application of quantum computing.[60] Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a collider.[61] In June 2023, IBM computer scientists reported that a quantum computer produced better results for a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.[62][63]

About 2% of the annual global energy output is used for nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia for the Haber process in the agricultural fertilizer industry (even though naturally occurring organisms also produce ammonia). Quantum simulations might be used to understand this process and increase the energy efficiency of production.[64] It is expected that an early use of quantum computing will be modeling that improves the efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process[65] by the mid-2020s[66] although some have predicted it will take longer.[67]

A notable application of quantum computation is for attacks on cryptographic systems that are currently in use. Integer factorization, which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).[68] By comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor's algorithm to find its factors.[69] This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the RSA, Diffie–Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.

Identifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of post-quantum cryptography.[70][71] Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, like the McEliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory.[70][72] Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem.[73] It has been proven that applying Grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (secret key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2n/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2n in the classical case,[74] meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have the same security against an attack using Grover's algorithm that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see Key size).

The most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is unstructured search, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 items in a database. This can be solved by Grover's algorithm using 



O
(


n


)


{\displaystyle O({\sqrt {n}})}

 queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the 



Ω
(

)


{\displaystyle \Omega (n)}

 queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions,[75] and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.[76]

Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:[77][78]

For problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which Grover's algorithm can be applied[79] is a Boolean satisfiability problem, where the database through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers. An example and possible application of this is a password cracker that attempts to guess a password. Breaking symmetric ciphers with this algorithm is of interest to government agencies.[80]

Quantum annealing relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which slowly evolves to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process. Adiabatic optimization may be helpful for solving computational biology problems.[81]

Since quantum computers can produce outputs that classical computers cannot produce efficiently, and since quantum computation is fundamentally linear algebraic, some express hope in developing quantum algorithms that can speed up machine learning tasks.[46][82]

For example, the HHL Algorithm, named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is believed to provide speedup over classical counterparts.[46][83] Some research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks.[84][85][86]


Deep generative chemistry models emerge as powerful tools to expedite drug discovery. However, the immense size and complexity of the structural space of all possible drug-like molecules pose significant obstacles, which could be overcome in the future by quantum computers. Quantum computers are naturally good for solving complex quantum many-body problems[20] and thus may be instrumental in applications involving quantum chemistry. Therefore, one can expect that quantum-enhanced generative models[87] including quantum GANs[88] may eventually be developed into ultimate generative chemistry algorithms.

As of 2023,[update] classical computers outperform quantum computers for all real-world applications. While current quantum computers may speed up solutions to particular mathematical problems, they give no computational advantage for practical tasks. Scientists and engineers are exploring multiple technologies for quantum computing hardware and hope to develop scalable quantum architectures, but serious obstacles remain.[89][90]

There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer.[91] Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these requirements for a practical quantum computer:[92]

Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult. Superconducting quantum computers, like those constructed by Google and IBM, need helium-3, a nuclear research byproduct, and special superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.[93]

The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of quantum controllers that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.[94]

One of the greatest challenges involved with constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.[95] Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator[96]) in order to prevent significant decoherence.[97] A 2020 study argues that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.[98]

As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.[99]

These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time; hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.

As described by the threshold theorem, if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10−3, assuming the noise is depolarizing.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L2, where L is the number of binary digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error correction.[100] With error correction, the figure would rise to about 107 bits. Computation time is about L2 or about 107 steps and at 1 MHz, about 10 seconds. However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude. Careful estimates[101][102] show that at least 3 million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer. In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate[103] for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger.

Another approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads, and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates.[104][105]

Physicist John Preskill coined the term quantum supremacy to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers.[106][107][108] The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.[109]

In October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the Sycamore quantum computer more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on Summit, generally considered the world's fastest computer.[26][110][111] This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed,[112][113] and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers[114][115][116] and even beating it.[117][118][119]

In December 2020, a group at USTC implemented a type of Boson sampling on 76 photons with a photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, to demonstrate quantum supremacy.[120][121][122] The authors claim that a classical contemporary supercomputer would require a computational time of 600 million years to generate the number of samples their quantum processor can generate in 20 seconds.[123]

Claims of quantum supremacy have generated hype around quantum computing,[124] but they are based on contrived benchmark tasks that do not directly imply useful real-world applications.[89][125]

In January 2024, a study published in Physical Review Letters provided direct verification of quantum supremacy experiments by computing exact amplitudes for experimentally generated bitstrings using a new-generation Sunway supercomputer, demonstrating a significant leap in simulation capability built on a multiple-amplitude tensor network contraction algorithm. This development underscores the evolving landscape of quantum computing, highlighting both the progress and the complexities involved in validating quantum supremacy claims.[126]

Despite high hopes for quantum computing, significant progress in hardware, and optimism about future applications, a 2023 Nature spotlight article summarized current quantum computers as being ""For now, [good for] absolutely nothing"".[89] The article elaborated that quantum computers are yet to be more useful or efficient than conventional computers in any case, though it also argued that in the long term such computers are likely to be useful. A 2023 Communications of the ACM article[90] found that current quantum computing algorithms are ""insufficient for practical quantum advantage without significant improvements across the software/hardware stack"". It argues that the most promising candidates for achieving speedup with quantum computers are ""small-data problems"", for example in chemistry and materials science. However, the article also concludes that a large range of the potential applications it considered, such as machine learning, ""will not achieve quantum advantage with current quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future"", and it identified I/O constraints that make speedup unlikely for ""big data problems, unstructured linear systems, and database search based on Grover's algorithm"".

This state of affairs can be traced to several current and long-term considerations.

In particular, building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain sufficiently high degree of entanglement for a long time. When trying to outperform conventional computers, quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers, but this leaves the possibility that efficient non-quantum techniques will be developed in response, as seen for Quantum supremacy demonstrations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible non-quantum algorithms (which may be unknown) and show that some quantum algorithms asymptomatically improve upon those bounds.

Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum computers could ever be built, typically because of the issue of maintaining coherence at large scales, but also for other reasons.

Bill Unruh doubted the practicality of quantum computers in a paper published in 1994.[129] Paul Davies argued that a 400-qubit computer would even come into conflict with the cosmological information bound implied by the holographic principle.[130] Skeptics like Gil Kalai doubt that quantum supremacy will ever be achieved.[131][132][133] Physicist Mikhail Dyakonov has expressed skepticism of quantum computing as follows:

A practical quantum computer must use a physical system as a programmable quantum register.[137] Researchers are exploring several technologies as candidates for reliable qubit implementations.[138] Superconductors and trapped ions are some of the most developed proposals, but experimentalists are considering other hardware possibilities as well.[139]

The first quantum logic gates were implemented with trapped ions and prototype general purpose machines with up to 20 qubits have been realized. However, the technology behind these devices combines complex vacuum equipment, lasers, microwave and radio frequency equipment making full scale processors difficult to integrate with standard computing equipment. Moreover, the trapped ion system itself has engineering challenges to overcome.[140]

The largest commercial systems are based on superconductor devices and have scaled to 2000 qubits. However, the error rates for larger machines have been on the order of 5%. Technologically these devices are all cryogenic and scaling to large numbers of qubits requires wafer-scale integration, a serious engineering challenge by itself.[141]

Research efforts to create stabler qubits for quantum computing include topological quantum computer approaches. For example, Microsoft is working on a computer based on the quantum properties of two-dimensional quasiparticles called anyons.[142][143][144]

With focus on business management's point of view, the potential applications of quantum computing into four major categories are cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation, and data management and searching.[145]

Investment in quantum computing research has increased in the public and private sectors.[146][147]
As one consulting firm summarized,[148]

... investment dollars are pouring in, and quantum-computing start-ups are proliferating. ... While quantum computing promises to help businesses solve problems that are beyond the reach and speed of conventional high-performance computers, use cases are largely experimental and hypothetical at this early stage.
Any computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer.[149] Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics, which underlies the operation of quantum computers.

Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a Turing machine. In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of computability. This means that quantum computers cannot solve undecidable problems like the halting problem, and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the Church–Turing thesis.[150]

While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently factor integers, while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.

The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called BQP, for ""bounded error, quantum, polynomial time"". More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to BPP (""bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time""), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machines with bounded error.[151] It is known that 





B

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {BPP\subseteq BQP}}}

 and is widely suspected that 





B
Q
P
⊊
B
P
P




{\displaystyle {\mathsf {BQP\subsetneq BPP}}}

, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.[152]

The exact relationship of BQP to P, NP, and PSPACE is not known. However, it is known that 





P

B
Q

E




{\displaystyle {\mathsf {P\subseteq BQP\subseteq PSPACE}}}

; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that 





N

Q

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {NP\nsubseteq BQP}}}

; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of NP-complete problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from NP-hardness that all problems in NP are in BQP).[153]

Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena to perform calculations that classical computers cannot efficiently handle. The fundamental unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, which can exist in a superposition of states, unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1. This unique property allows quantum computers to process complex computations at unprecedented speeds.

We discussed the current state of quantum computing technology, noting that while it remains largely experimental and impractical for widespread use, significant progress has been made. For instance, Google AI and NASA claimed to have achieved ""quantum supremacy"" with a 54-qubit machine in 2019, although this claim is still under scrutiny. Additionally, recent advancements include the entanglement of individual molecules reported by physicists in December 2023.

The session highlighted several challenges facing the development of practical quantum computers. These include engineering high-quality qubits that can maintain coherence over time and reducing error rates during computations. National governments and private sectors are heavily investing in research to overcome these obstacles.

Quantum computing's potential applications were a major focus. It could revolutionize fields such as cryptography by breaking widely used encryption schemes through algorithms like Shor's algorithm. Quantum simulations could also enhance our understanding of chemical processes and materials science, potentially leading to more efficient industrial processes like ammonia production for fertilizers.

Despite its promise, we acknowledged that current quantum computers do not yet outperform classical computers for real-world applications. Theoretical models suggest that quantum algorithms can offer exponential speedups for specific problems, but practical implementation remains elusive due to technical limitations.

Our conclusions emphasized the need for continued research and development in both hardware and software aspects of quantum computing. We identified key action items: supporting ongoing experimental research to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times, exploring new cryptographic systems resistant to quantum attacks (post-quantum cryptography), and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between physicists and computer scientists to advance algorithm design.

Overall, while optimistic about the future impact of quantum computing, we recognized that achieving practical utility will require overcoming significant scientific and engineering hurdles.","[""Scene 1: Opening and Greetings\nTLDR: Brief welcome and setting the tone for the session\n- Quick greeting among participants\n- Overview of meeting objectives and expected outcomes\n- Encouragement for open, creative contributions"", ""Scene 2: Current State of Quantum Computing\nTLDR: Discuss recent advancements and current challenges in quantum computing\n- Highlight Google AI and NASA's \""quantum supremacy\"" claim\n- Mention recent entanglement of individual molecules\n- Open floor for spontaneous thoughts on these developments"", ""Scene 3: Engineering Challenges in Quantum Computing\nTLDR: Explore technical hurdles in developing practical quantum computers\n- Discuss issues with qubit coherence and error rates\n- Invite personal experiences from participants working on hardware solutions"", ""Scene 4: Potential Applications of Quantum Computing\nTLDR: Brainstorm possible uses of quantum computing across various fields\n- Cryptography breakthroughs (e.g., Shor's algorithm)\n- Enhancements in chemical processes and materials science through simulations\n- Encourage sharing of innovative application ideas"", ""Scene 5: Overcoming Technical Limitations\nTLDR: Identify strategies to address current limitations in quantum computing technology\n- Support for ongoing experimental research on scalable qubits\n- Exploration of post-quantum cryptography systems resistant to quantum attacks"", ""Scene 6: Interdisciplinary Collaboration Opportunities\nTLDR: Foster collaboration between different fields to advance quantum computing research \n - Discuss the importance of physicists and computer scientists working together \n - Share examples or success stories from past collaborations \n - Open discussion for new collaborative project ideas"", ""Scene 7: Prioritizing Concepts for Further Exploration \n TLDR : Narrow down the list of potential ideas generated during the session \n - Review key points discussed so far \n - Vote or reach a consensus on top concepts to prioritize \n - Assign action items or next steps for further exploration"", ""Scene 8 : Closing Remarks & Next Steps \n TLDR : Summarize key takeaways and outline next steps \\ n - Recap main ideas generated during the session \\ n - Outline immediate next steps or follow-up actions required \\ n - Thank participants for their contributions""]",">>Quantum Physicist: Hi everyone! Excited to kick off today's session on quantum computing advancements. Let's dive into the latest breakthroughs and see how they can impact various fields.

>>Computer Scientist: Morning! Building on what you said, I'm really looking forward to discussing how these new developments can change our approach to software development and data processing.

>>Cryptography Expert: Hey guys, just a quick reminder about the importance of quantum-resistant algorithms as we discuss these topics. Without them, our current encryption methods could be at risk.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: Hello all! Looking forward to chatting about the latest in quantum tech. I've got some cool updates on hardware design that could really speed up practical implementations. 
 >>Quantum Physicist: Um, in the realm of quantum mechanics, the recent entanglement of individual molecules is truly groundbreaking! This could potentially revolutionize how we approach quantum computing, especially in terms of coherence and error rates. And speaking of breakthroughs, Google's claim of achieving 'quantum supremacy' suggests that quantum computers can solve specific problems faster than classical supercomputers. It's a huge leap for computational efficiency.

>>Computer Scientist: Yeah, the entanglement of individual molecules is a significant milestone. But from an algorithmic perspective, how do we ensure these advancements translate into practical improvements? Like, can this help reduce error rates or enhance coherence times? And about Google's achievement, it's fascinating but raises the question: how do we leverage this to solve real-world problems efficiently?

>>Cryptography Expert: I mean, while these advancements are impressive, we need to consider their security implications. Faster computation speeds are great, but it also means our current cryptographic systems could become vulnerable much sooner than anticipated. How do we address that?

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: You know, from a hardware standpoint, maintaining the delicate states of entangled molecules over extended periods is challenging. But if we can crack that nut, it would indeed enhance coherence times and reduce error rates significantly. As for Google's breakthrough, it's a huge step forward! We just need to figure out how to implement these practically.

>>Quantum Physicist: Exactly! Theoretically speaking, this advancement opens new avenues for exploring quantum error correction techniques. However, um, maintaining such delicate states over time remains a practical challenge.

>>Computer Scientist: Right! So from an algorithmic perspective, Google's achievement is indeed a landmark. But efficiency is key here. How do we ensure these advancements translate into practical improvements in algorithms? Can this help with error correction or enhancing coherence times? And what about real-world applications?

>>Cryptography Expert: Well... that's where things get tricky. We need to develop quantum-resistant algorithms now more than ever to stay ahead of potential threats posed by these advancements.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: Absolutely! Implementing these breakthroughs practically will require us to rethink our current approaches to hardware design and integration with existing systems.

>>Quantum Physicist: Yes! From a theoretical standpoint, the concept suggests that quantum computers can outperform classical supercomputers in specific tasks. However, like I said before, maintaining coherence and reducing error rates are still major hurdles.

>>Computer Scientist: Hmm... so we're looking at both opportunities and challenges here. It's exciting but also daunting when you think about all the work still needed to make these advancements usable on a larger scale. 
 >>Quantum Computing Engineer: So, um, one of the biggest challenges we face is maintaining qubit coherence. Even the slightest environmental interference can cause decoherence, which introduces errors in our calculations.

>>Quantum Physicist: Absolutely, that's a tough one. The delicate nature of qubits makes them highly susceptible to disturbances. One promising approach we're looking into is topological qubits; they might offer better error resistance due to their unique properties.

>>Computer Scientist: Right, and from an algorithmic perspective, keeping those qubits stable is crucial for efficiency. Quantum error correction codes are key here—they help manage noise and keep our computations accurate over time.

>>Quantum Physicist: Exactly! These error correction techniques allow us to detect and fix errors without directly measuring the qubits, which would otherwise mess up their states. It's like adding extra layers of protection using redundancy and entanglement.

>>Cryptography Expert (interrupting): Sorry to interrupt—this discussion on error correction is really interesting. Do these codes have any implications for cryptographic protocols? How does it affect the security of our quantum communications?

>>Computer Scientist: Great question! Yes, they do impact security significantly. Quantum error correction not only maintains computational integrity but also enhances security by protecting against eavesdropping attempts that introduce noise into the system.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: On a practical note, coordinating all the control signals for multi-qubit systems is a real challenge. Timing has to be incredibly precise. Have any of you faced similar issues?

>>Quantum Physicist: Definitely! It's like trying to synchronize musicians in an orchestra; even slight timing errors can cause problems or computational errors in our case. 
 Computer Scientist: So, let's dive into the potential applications of quantum computing. Efficiency is key here, especially when we consider Shor's algorithm for cryptography. Think about the breakthroughs in chemical processes and materials science through advanced simulations. What other innovative application ideas do you all have?

Quantum Physicist: In material science, leveraging quantum simulations can model complex molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy. This could lead to breakthroughs in developing new materials with tailored properties for specific applications, like superconductors or advanced pharmaceuticals.

Quantum Computing Engineer: You know, quantum computing could revolutionize logistics and supply chain management by optimizing complex networks and solving problems like the traveling salesman problem much faster. But are we really close to achieving that level of practical application yet?

Cryptography Expert: Good point! And in cryptographic terms, the potential of quantum computing to break widely used encryption schemes like RSA through Shor's algorithm is concerning. Basically, it can solve problems that would take classical computers millions of years in just seconds. We need to develop algorithms that can withstand these powerful computational capabilities.

Quantum Physicist: From a theoretical standpoint, quantum computing could also revolutionize artificial intelligence. By leveraging quantum algorithms, we can process vast amounts of data simultaneously, leading to more efficient machine learning models and faster training times.

Computer Scientist: Absolutely! And speaking of algorithms... Grover's algorithm could transform data analytics by searching through massive datasets exponentially faster than classical methods. How do you think this would impact industries that rely heavily on big data?

Quantum Computing Engineer: Well... imagine solving complex problems like protein folding or financial modeling with unprecedented speed and accuracy! The implications for industries such as pharmaceuticals and finance are simply amazing!

Cryptography Expert: And don't forget about cybersecurity! As we advance these technologies, we need robust defenses against potential threats.

Computer Scientist: Right, but let's not get too carried away with optimism here. There are still significant technical challenges to overcome before these applications become reality. 
 >>Quantum Physicist: Using 'quantum entanglement' could really help with error correction and improve accuracy. What do you think about this approach for scalable qubits?

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: That's a good point! We should look at how to integrate scalable qubits like superconducting qubits into bigger systems effectively. It's not just about having advanced qubits but making sure they work well together in a practical setup.

>>Computer Scientist: Absolutely, improving error correction will cut down noise in our algorithms. But what about keeping our encryption safe? How do we ensure it remains secure against these advancements?

>>Cryptography Expert: We need to work on post-quantum cryptography to protect against future threats from quantum computing. If we don't develop quantum-resistant cryptographic systems now, all our advancements could be at risk.

>>Quantum Physicist: Right, and while we're focusing on the theoretical aspects, it's crucial that ongoing experimental research supports these ideas. Superconducting qubits and ion traps are promising, but they need to be scalable.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: Exactly! And integrating these scalable qubits into larger systems is key. We can't overlook the hardware challenges here.

>>Computer Scientist: Enhancing error correction techniques will definitely reduce noise and improve computational accuracy for quantum algorithms. But again, how do we balance this with ensuring our encryption methods stay secure?

>>Cryptography Expert: Security is paramount here. Developing post-quantum cryptography alongside scalable qubits should be a priority to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities introduced by quantum computing. 
 >>Quantum Physicist: Collaboration between our fields is essential. Theoretical insights need practical implementations to be impactful, like with Shor's algorithm.

>>Computer Scientist: Absolutely. Quantum algorithms show how powerful our partnership can be.

>>Quantum Physicist: And think about quantum entanglement—it allows for sophisticated error correction codes, which are crucial for practical quantum computing.

>>Cryptography Expert: How do we ensure security in these collaborations? We need to address potential vulnerabilities from quantum advancements.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: Good point. We've seen progress when integrating superconducting qubits—physicists provide the theory, and we handle the hardware challenges.

>>Computer Scientist: Right! Those success stories highlight why it's so important for us to keep working together. By combining our strengths, we can tackle complex problems more effectively.

>>Quantum Physicist: Moving forward, what new projects could benefit from our combined expertise?

>>Cryptography Expert: I've been thinking about developing quantum-resistant cryptographic methods alongside advancements in scalable qubits. It’s crucial for ensuring security as we move forward with quantum computing technologies.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: That sounds promising! Another idea could be focusing on improving error correction techniques by leveraging new insights from quantum mechanics and applying them practically in hardware design.

>>Computer Scientist: Definitely! And maybe we could explore optimizing existing algorithms further by incorporating real-time feedback from hardware performance data—kind of like a continuous improvement loop between theory and practice. 
 >>Quantum Physicist: Alright, let's review what we've discussed so far—quantum error correction, scalable qubits, and post-quantum cryptographic methods. How about we figure out which ones to focus on first?

>>Computer Scientist: Yeah, from an algorithmic perspective, integrating scalable qubits and developing post-quantum cryptographic methods are crucial. Efficiency is key here. Improving these areas could significantly enhance both computational accuracy and security.

>>Cryptography Expert: I get that, but from a security standpoint, quantum-resistant algorithms should be our top priority to protect against future threats.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: True, but practical implementation matters too. Without reliable error correction techniques, none of this will work effectively in practice.

>>Quantum Physicist: Good points all around. Let's decide our priorities then—error correction, scalable qubits, or post-quantum cryptography?

>>Computer Scientist: Sure thing! I'll start—my vote goes to scalable qubits for advancing overall capabilities.

>>Cryptography Expert: I'm all for prioritizing post-quantum cryptographic methods due to the security implications.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: And I think improving error correction techniques should come first because it's essential for practical applications.

>>Quantum Physicist: Great! We've got a good spread of priorities here. Now let's assign some action items for further exploration. 
 >>Computer Scientist: Alright, let's break this down. We need to focus on integrating scalable qubits with robust error correction codes and prioritize algorithms for noise reduction. Efficiency is key here.

>>Cryptography Expert: And we can't forget about security. We need to develop quantum-resistant algorithms to protect our encryption methods from future quantum attacks.

>>Quantum Physicist: Absolutely, but we should also dive into the theoretical aspects of quantum entanglement. It can really help us enhance coherence and reduce error rates.

>>Quantum Computing Engineer: Yeah, um, I think it's important we also look at the practical side of things. What do you all think about focusing on hardware testing?

>>Computer Scientist: Good point! Reliable hardware is crucial. Let's add that to our priorities.

>>Cryptography Expert: So, how about we get a team together right away for each of these areas? One for error correction and scalable qubits, one for post-quantum cryptography, and another for hardware testing?

>>Quantum Physicist: Sounds good to me. And let's make sure we're documenting everything thoroughly so we have a clear reference for future discussions.

>>Cryptography Expert: Agreed. Keeping good notes will keep us on track and help us make informed decisions moving forward.
